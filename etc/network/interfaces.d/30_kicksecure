## Loopback interface.
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

## When using Virtual Machines (not Physical Isolation),
## - eth0 is the NAT interface to communicate with VirtualBox
## - used to get access to the internet
## - it will get an IP address such as 10.0.2.15
## - Thus, the this IP address can NOT cause conflicts
##   with your LAN network or router.
## We no longer use DHCP.

## Or alternatively we could use...
## (Out commented by default.)
## NAT interface to communicate with VirtualBox.
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 10.0.2.15
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 10.0.2.2
        ## broadcast required?
        #broadcast 10.0.2.255

## When using Virtual Machines (not Physical Isolation),
## - eth1 is an internal, isolated, virtual network,
## - provided and only visible inside Virtual Machines
## - solely used to communicate with the Workstation.
## - it has has no access to the host
## - Thus, the following IP address can NOT cause conflicts
##   with your LAN network or router.
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
       ## INT_IP and INT_IF
       address 10.152.152.10
       netmask 255.255.192.0
       ## Out commented.
       ## For what do we need network and broadcast anyway?
       #network 192.168.0.0
       #broadcast 192.168.0.255
